      <h3>Conditional Expressions</h3>
      <p>
        In my recreation of the game PONG, conditional expressions play a central role in the game's physics.
        For example, to decide whether the ball should bounce off one of the paddles, the game checks if the ball's
        current height is between the top and bottom ends of the paddle and if its horizontal position is right in
        front of the paddle (with some bound for error).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another use of conditional expressions is to keep the paddles from moving off the screen. For the player's
        paddle, for example, if the top of the paddle is within a certain distance from the top edge of the playing
        field, the game will not move the paddle any further up, even if the player is still pressing the up arrow.
      </p>

      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>
        My recreation of SNAKE makes heavy use of arrays. In particular, the snake is mainly represented by two arrays:
        one for its body and one for its "skeleton."
      </p>
      <p>
        The body array contains a list of coordinates (really just arrays of size 2), representing the location of each
        segment in the snake's body. Each time step, a new coordinate is added to the front of the array (the head) that
        is slightly in front of the current head, and the coordinate at the end of the array (the tail) is removed. This
        lets the snake move smoothly from the point of view of the player.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the body array may contain many segments, I implemented a "skeleton" array to try and improve performance.
        The skeleton array contains only those coordinates representing the cells occupied by the snake in the grid of
        movement. Then, instead of checking every segment of the body every frame to see if the snake has collided into
        itself, the game only needs to check the handful of segments in the skeleton.
      </p>

      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>
        There are quite a few bricks in the game BRICKS. Manipulating each one individually would be a huge
        pain and severely restrict my ability to change, e.g., how the bricks are laid out or how I detect
        collisions between the bricks and the ball. For that reason, BRICKS makes heavy use of loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        When setting up the game, I use a few for-loops to initialize the positions of the bricks. That way,
        I don't have to position them each individually, and it is easy to change e.g. how many bricks are in
        a row or how many rows of bricks there are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, during the game, a for-loop iterates over the bricks each frame to check whether the ball has
        collided with any of them. If so, the brick gets removed, the ball bounces, and the for-loop ends.
        Finally, I use a for-loop when drawing the bricks each frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see the for-loops of BRICKS in action <a href="bricks.html">here</a>.

      <h3>jQuery</h3>
      <p>
        I used the jQuery library to implement two different sidebars on my home page.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sidebar on the left, a sliding animation hides/reveals a response when the user selects
        an answer to the question. To do this, I used jQuery's .on() method to add 'click' event listeners to
        the two radio buttons, and I used the .slideUp() and .slideDown() methods to create the animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the right, there is a clock which updates every second (1000 ms). I use jQuery to get the elements
        for the date and time texts and then use the .html() jQuery method to set the updated text for each element.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>Form Validation</h3>
      <p>
        Under the 'Submit' tab, there is a form that allows a user to submit an idea or request for a new game
        to be added to the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        For validation, I included a script that adds 'blur' event listeners to disable the submit button until all
        fields have been completed. When a user leaves a field, the event listener for that field will revalidate
        the form to see if it is ready to be submitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The script also limits the description of the game to 200 characters through an 'input' event listener on
        the text area and provides an updated "characters remaining" count as a user types.
      </p>
